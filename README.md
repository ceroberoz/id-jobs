ðŸ“Š **View Job Data:** [https://s.id/id-jobs-v2](https://s.id/id-jobs-v2)

id-jobs: Because searching for a job shouldn't feel like finding a needle in a haystack... made of more needles.

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© **Important:** id-jobs is specifically designed for the Indonesian job market. If you're looking for jobs in Antarctica, you're in the wrong place (but we admire your adventurous spirit!).

## Why id-jobs?

Ever felt like finding a job in Indonesia is like trying to herd cats while juggling flaming torches? Say no more! id-jobs gathers job listings faster than you can say "Aku butuh pekerjaan!"

## How it Works

Picture id-jobs as your personal job-hunting ninja. It stealthily visits Indonesian job websites, grabs the goods, and presents it all in one tidy spreadsheet. No black outfit or throwing stars required!

We currently infiltrate... err, collect data from:
- Jobstreet Indonesia (not to be confused with Sesame Street)
- Glints Indonesia (shinier than regular Indonesia)
- Kalibrr (fun to say, even more fun to find jobs on)
- And more local sources than you can shake a stick at!

## Making Sense of the Data

With all this Indonesian job data at your fingertips, you can:
- Spot trends faster than a teenager spots a new TikTok dance
- Create charts so beautiful, they'll make Excel jealous
- Use spreadsheet functions to analyze the job market (Warning: May cause unexpected bouts of "I love data!")
