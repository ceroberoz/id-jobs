## What's cooking in id-jobs? 🍳

id-jobs is like a job-listing buffet - we've got a little bit of everything! We use Python and Scrapy (no actual spiders were harmed) to keep our data fresher than your morning coffee.

## Why id-jobs will be your new best friend ❤️

- 🕒 Fresher than your ex's Instagram updates: We refresh DAILY at 00:00 UTC
- 🌈 More comprehensive than your mom's Facebook stalking: Even more job sources in v2.0
- 📊 More accurate than your fitness tracker's step count
- 👩‍💻 So beginner-friendly, even your technophobe uncle could use it

## A tiny hiccup (or as we like to call it, a feature!) ⚠️

Some of our spider friends are taking an unplanned vacation due to website changes. We're coaxing them back to work faster than you can say "You're on mute" in a Zoom call. Thanks for bearing with us!

## Who's this for? Everyone! But especially... 👥

- Job seekers tired of scrolling through countless irrelevant listings
- Recruiters who want to be the Sherlock Holmes of the job market
- Data nerds who get excited about pivot tables (we see you, and we appreciate you)
- Coding newbies ready to level up from "Hello World" to "Hello Job Market"

## Get started faster than you can say "I quit"! 🚀

1. Clone the repo (it's like adopting a digital pet):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ceroberoz/id-jobs.git
   cd id-jobs
   ```

2. Set up your environment (think of it as building a cozy home for your code):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies (like furnishing your code's new home):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

4. Run your first job crawler (unleash the spiders!):
   ```
   scrapy crawl <crawler-name>
   ```
   Replace `<crawler-name>` with your chosen crawler (e.g., `vidio`, `gotogroup`)

## Turn data into eye candy 📊

Want to make charts so pretty they belong in a museum? Here's how:

1. Download the Google Sheet as a CSV file.
2. Import this CSV into tools like Google Looker Studio or Tableau.
3. Create dashboards that would make even Edward Tufte jealous!
