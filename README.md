## Job Age Color Guidelines

To help users quickly identify the freshness of job listings, we use a color-coded system based on the job's age:

| Job Age Category | Time Range | Color | Description |
|------------------|------------|-------|-------------|
| New | <= 1 day | ![#B3E6B3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/B3E6B3/000000?text=+) Bright Light Green | Most recent and attractive opportunities |
| Hot | 1 to 7 days | ![#FFCC66](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFCC66/000000?text=+) Warm Light Orange | Very recent and appealing listings |
| Recent | 8 to 15 days | ![#99CCFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/99CCFF/000000?text=+) Light Blue | Still fresh and noteworthy opportunities |
| Aging | 16 to 21 days | ![#F2F2F2](https://via.placeholder.com/15/F2F2F2/000000?text=+) Very Light Gray | Older listings, less priority |
| Old | 22 to 30 days | ![#E6E6E6](https://via.placeholder.com/15/E6E6E6/000000?text=+) Light Gray | Significantly older listings, low priority |
| Expired | > 30 days | ![#D9D9D9](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D9D9D9/000000?text=+) Medium Gray | Outdated listings, likely no longer active |

This color scheme is designed to guide users towards the most recent job opportunities while de-emphasizing older listings.
