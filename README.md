## Overview

ðŸ“Š **View Job Data:** [https://s.id/id-jobs-v2](https://s.id/id-jobs-v2)

id-jobs is a tool that collects job listings from various Indonesian job boards and company websites, organizing them into one easy-to-access Google Sheet.

ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© **Important:** id-jobs is specifically designed for the Indonesian job market.

## Why id-jobs?

Finding the right job in Indonesia can be challenging, with information scattered across multiple websites. id-jobs simplifies this process by gathering job information from various Indonesian sources into one place, making it easier for job seekers to find opportunities.

## How it Works

id-jobs automatically visits Indonesian job websites, collects relevant information, and organizes it all in one spreadsheet. This process, called web scraping, is done respectfully and in line with each website's terms of service.

## Data Sources

- Jobstreet Indonesia
- Glints Indonesia
- Kalibrr
- TopKarir

- Various company career pages

## Using the Data

With all this Indonesian job data in one place, you can:
- Identify trends in job titles, salaries, or locations across Indonesia
- Create visual charts and graphs using tools like Google Looker Studio or Tableau
- Use spreadsheet functions to filter and analyze the Indonesian job market
